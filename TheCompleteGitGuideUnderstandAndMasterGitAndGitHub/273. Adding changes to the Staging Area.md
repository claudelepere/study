# 273. Adding changes to the Staging Area

3 areas:

- working directory
- staging area or index
- Git repository = .git

in git-repository: ls -la .git/objects → info and pack

When you check out specific files from Git repository, they move through staging area into the working directory

- git add: from working directory to staging area: stage
- git commit: from staging area to Git repository: commit
- git checkout: from Git repository to staging area: jump into certain “version” of the project

git add .: add all changed or untracked files into the staging area

git commit: take staged files from staging area and place them into the Git repository, creates corresponding objects in the .git/objects folder and after git commit, Git creates Git commit object, with its unique SHA1 hash

git checkout different commits

untracked = the file is not tracked by Git
