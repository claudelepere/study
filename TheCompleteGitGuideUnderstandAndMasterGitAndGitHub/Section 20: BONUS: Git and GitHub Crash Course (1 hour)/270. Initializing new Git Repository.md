# 270. Initializing new Git Repository

git init

clep@clep-ubuntu:~/Desktop/Udemy/BogdanStashChuk/git-repository $

.git = git repository where Git stores all its files: every version of every file in your working directory

git-repository = working directory

git branch -m main

Currently there is single branch main but it is not shown here in the output now because we have not yet committed any changes. As soon as you commit changes, it will appear in this list

We initialized new empty Git repository in the folder git-repository

Usually entire folder that is managed by Git (= under Git control) is called Git repository
