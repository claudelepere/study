# 281. Branches and merging of the branchesFIRST


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


root commit = the very first commit in the project

merge specific feature branch into the main branch

merging process:
1. Create new feature branch from the main branch
2. Make changes in the new branch and commit them
3. Checkout main branch (receiving branch)
4. Merge feature branch into the currently checked out receiving branch
git merge \<feature-branch>

3-way merge:
root commit ← ← ancestor ←  ←  ← merge commit: main branch
                                ancestor ← ← ← merge commit: feature branch

Git creates the new merge commit
