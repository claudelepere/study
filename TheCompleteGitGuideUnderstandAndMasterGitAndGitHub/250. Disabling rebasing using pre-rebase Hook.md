# 250. Disabling rebasing using pre-rebase Hook

## rebasing

- step 1: rebase feature1 branch **on top of main branch**
  - git checkout feature1
  - git rebase main
- step 2: fast-forward merge feature1 branch into main branch
  - git checkout main
  - git merge feature1

## pre-rebase Hook

chmod +x pre-rebase

shebang: sh, bash is also OK

force delete feature1 branch: git branch -D feature1
