# 276. Exploring commits history


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git log ⇒  
commit SHA1 hash (HEAD → main):  
main pointer = pointer of the branch to  this last commit  
Date: = when this commit was made  
HEAD pointer = points to main branch that points to this commit with this SHA1 hash  
HEAD = dynamic pointer: represents your current location

if checkout another branch, Git simply moves the HEAD pointer to this branch

if checkout specific commit, idem, HEAD moves to the commit;  
to get back: git switch - or git checkout main

second file: 2.txt

yellow cross x = if there are uncommitted changes on Mac
