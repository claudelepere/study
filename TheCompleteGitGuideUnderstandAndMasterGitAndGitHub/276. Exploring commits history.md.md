# 276. Exploring commits history


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git log ⇒  
commit SHA1 hash (HEAD → main):  
- main = pointer of the branch to this last commit
- Author: name  and email
- Date: = when this commit was made
- message
- HEAD pointer = points to main branch that points to this commit with this SHA1 hash  
HEAD = dynamic pointer: represents your current location

if check out another branch, Git simply moves the HEAD pointer to this branch

if check out specific commit, idem, HEAD moves to the commit;  
to get back: git switch - or git checkout main

second file: 2.txt

yellow cross x = if there are uncommitted changes on Mac

1 file changed, 1 insertion(+):  
- 1 file changed and there was 1 line in that file
- "+" means that this new line was added

sign + = line added  
sign - = line removed

After committing, Git automatically moves the current branch pointer to the last commit  
HEAD pointer moves along with branch, it doesn't know that there is a new commit, it points only to the branch
