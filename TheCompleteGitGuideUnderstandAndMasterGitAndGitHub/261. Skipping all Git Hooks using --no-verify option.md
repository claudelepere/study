# 261. Skipping all Git Hooks using --no-verify option

- git commit -a -n -m "Commit broken app anyway"
- git push is also possible
- Why this --no-verify option? You should always add additional layer of protection from the bad code in your central repository and run checks there for every pushed change or for every opened Pull Request.
- You also should configure some main branches (main/master/release) as protected branches to disable direct pushes to them
- Also you could run tests, linting, etc. in the central repository for every Pull Request and block merging if some tests fail or some other requirements are not met
- use Git actions or Travis CI (?)
- You could enable a test run for every push to a remote repository
