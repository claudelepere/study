# 248. Using pre-commit Hook

Git creates sample Git Hooks when you initialize a new repo; they are disabled by default (sample extension).

mkdir git-hooks-local > git init > .git/hooks: commit-msg.sample = disabled, commit-msg = enabled

permissions = -rwxr-xr-x, x = executable file  
owner of the file | user group that owns the file | others  
u = user owner | g = group owner | o = others  
r = read | w = write | x = execute

#! = shebang => specify the interpreter

file deleted > git add . to clean the staging area

Git event = Git action = commit, etc.

shebang: #!/bin/bash instead of sh = OK
