# 278. Checking out commits and branches


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


commit's SHA1 hash: based on all the contents of the commit object, author's name and email, date and message

git checkout SHA1 hash →  
- detached HEAD state indicates that HEAD points to the specific commit instead of the specific branch
- HEAD is now at SHA1 hash First awesome commit
- ls → 1.txt, not 1.txt and 2.txt
- you move to another state of the repository
- git log → only the first commit: HEAD (dynamic pointer) points to this specific commit, there is no branch here at all

git checkout main → get back to the main branch:  
Previous HEAD position was SHA1 hash First awedo
