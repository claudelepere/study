# 275. Committing changes


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).

After committing changes, working directory, staging area and Git repository will be **synchronized**: file 1.txt will be present in all three areas.

git commit -m "First awesome commit"

nothing to commit, working tree clean = all three areas are synchronized
