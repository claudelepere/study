# 286. Pushing from the local repository to remoteFIRST


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git branch -M main: needless as the local branch is main
git branch (-m | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>:
With a `-m` or `-M` option, <oldbranch> will be renamed to <newbranch>. If <oldbranch> had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match <newbranch>, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming. If <newbranch> exists, -M must be used to force the rename to happen.

Reference logs, or "reflogs", record when the tips of branches and other references were updated in the local repository. Reflogs are useful in various Git commands, to specify the old value of a reference. For example, `HEAD@{2}` means "where HEAD used to be two moves ago", `master@{one.week.ago}` means "where master used to point to one week ago in this local repository", and so on.

git push -u origin main: from local main to origin main branch
-u: tells Git that it needs to create a new upstream branch, new branch in the remote repo

If you are pushing to GitHub for the first time you will be asked to enter your GitHub username and password (NO, personal access token)

\* [new branch] main (remote) -> main 
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin'
