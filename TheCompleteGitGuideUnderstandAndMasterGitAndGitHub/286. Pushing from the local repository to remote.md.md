# 286. Pushing from the local repository to remoteFIRST


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git branch -M main: needless as the local branch is main
git branch (-m | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>:
With a `-m` or `-M` option, <oldbranch> will be renamed to <newbranch>. If <oldbranch> had a corresponding reflog, it is renamed to match <newbranch>, and a reflog entry is created to remember the branch renaming. If <newbranch> exists, -M must be used to force the rename to happen.
