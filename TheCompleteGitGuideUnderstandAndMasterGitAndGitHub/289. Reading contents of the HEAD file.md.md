# 289. Reading contents of the HEAD fileFirst


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


cat HEAD => ref: refs/heads/main = reference to a specific branch

in git log => commit SHA1 hash (HEAD -> main, origin/main)

.git/regs => heads remotes tags

.git/objects: Git stores all versions of all files: blobs, trees, commits

all those files are spread across different subfolders and each folder has a name that consists of 2 hex characters
