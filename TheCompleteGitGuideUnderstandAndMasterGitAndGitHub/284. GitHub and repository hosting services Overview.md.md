Git = distributed version control system
GitHub, Bitbucket = repository hosting service

You could create an account at GitHub and create the remote repository there and afterwards you could connect your local Git repository  with the remote Github repository and make them synchronized

default remote repository name = origin = default name of remote
in the local repository: create new remote

advantages of the remote repository:
1. collaboration
2. safety
