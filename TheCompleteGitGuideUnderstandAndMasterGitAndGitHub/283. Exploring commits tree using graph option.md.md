# 283. Exploring commits tree using graph option


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git log --graph -> show the commit tree (two parents)

Now it is safe to remove the feature1 branch because it just points to a specific commit, nothing else; the commits themselves will be kept in place

git brancch -d feature1 =>
after: same commit: commit SHA1 hash: (feature1 disappaered)
