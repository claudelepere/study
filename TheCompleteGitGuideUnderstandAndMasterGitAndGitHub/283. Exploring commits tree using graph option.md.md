git log --graph -> display the commit tree (two parents)

Now it is safe to remove the feature1 branch because it just points to a specific commit, nothing else; the commits themselves will be kept in place

git brancch -d feature1 =>
after: same commit: commit SHA1 hash: (feature1 has disappeared)
