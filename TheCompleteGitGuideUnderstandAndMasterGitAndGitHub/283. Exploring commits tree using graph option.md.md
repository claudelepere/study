# 283. Exploring commits tree using graph option


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


git log --graph -> display the commit tree (two parents)

Now it is safe to remove the feature1 branch because it is just a pointer to a specific commit, nothing else; the commits themselves will be kept in place

before: commit SHA1 hash (feature1)
git branch -d feature1 =>
after: same commit: commit SHA1 hash: (feature1 pointer has disappeared)
