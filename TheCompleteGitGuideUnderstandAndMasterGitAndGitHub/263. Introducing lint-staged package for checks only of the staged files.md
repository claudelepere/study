# 263. Introducing lint-staged package for checks only of the staged files

- add other-file.js, it is empty
- There was no need to lint and test all files before commit because existing files were not changed
- install lint-staged package: npm i -D lint-staged
- package.json:  
  "lint-staged:" {  
    "*.js": [ = linting JavaScript files only  
      "eslint",  = eslint script with as argument staged js files list  
      "jest --findRelatedTests" = changed tests themselves and changed files that have related tests
    ]  
  }  
-
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
- commit:  
 husky > pre-commit (node v18.16.0)  
â†’ No staged files match any configured task.
