# 252. Local Git Hooks are NOT pushed to the remote

connect local repo and remote repo

git remote add origin git@github.com:alixnamoussart/git-hooks-local.git  
git push -u origin => KO

## SSH connection

J'ai regénéré les clés SSH de claudelepere et je les ai écrites dans alixnamoussart.

Test ssh connection in Linux & Unix: <https://www.golinuxcloud.com/test-ssh-connection/>:

 use timeout with bash utility to test SSH connection:

- check_SSH_connectivity.sh:  

```bash
#!/bin/bash

server=github.com
#server=140.82.121.3
port=22
connect_timeout=5

timeout $connect_timeout bash -c "</dev/tcp/$server/$port"
if [ $? == 0 ];
then
    echo "SSH connection to $server over port $port is possible"
else
    echo "SSH connection to $server over port $port is not possible"
fi
```

- chmod +x check_SSH_connectivity.sh
- run:
  - ./check_SSH_connectivity.sh
  - sudo bash check_SSH_connectivity.sh

git push -u origin => OK

Local hooks pushed or not? The most simple way to verify whether they are pushed or not is to clone the remote repo.

git clone https://github.com/mikegithubber/git-hooks-local.git git-hooks-local-from-remote: there already is a folder git-hooks-local

CONCLUSION: PROBLEM: Git Hooks are not pushed to remote, they are only local

SOLUTION 1:

- hooks in the working directory
- symbolic link in .git/hooks: those symbolic links must be created manually on each computer

SOLUTION 2:

- use packages or applications that will control Git Hooks located in the .git/hooks folder
- configuration for those packages will be located in the working directory
