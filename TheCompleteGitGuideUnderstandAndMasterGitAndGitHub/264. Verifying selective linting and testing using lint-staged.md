# 264. Verifying selective linting and testing using lint-staged

- "jest --findRelatedTests" = run tests related to changed files; only related to changes tests will be executed
- modify other-file.js: add a comment
- "jest --findRelatedTests --passWithNoTests" because no test for other-file.js
- break sum.js (a + b + b) and commit => only sum.test.js (test related to changed file) is run: jest will run tests selectively, only tests related to staged files
- break sum.js (a + b + 0), it is not a break, and commit
