# 285. Creating remote repository at GitHub


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


no README because we want to connect an already existing repository with the remote repository

... or push an existing repository from the command line:
- git remote add origin https://github.com/claudelepere/git-repository.git
- git branch -M main <<<<<<< unnecessary because we already have a main branch
- git push -u origin main

git remote -v ->
origin htt

fetch = download of the updates from remote to local
push = pushing changes from local to remote
