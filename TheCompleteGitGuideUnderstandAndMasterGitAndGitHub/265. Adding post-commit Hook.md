# 265. Adding post-commit Hook.md

pre-commit hook enabled using Husky runs lint-staged process that performs selective eslint checking and runs only selective tests related to JavaScript files located in staging area

- pre-commit script: eslint
- press-push script (= before pushing to remote): tests (this way = not selectively)

- "post-commit": "npm run success-message"
- "success-message": "echo Thanks for committing $GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"

no other related to staged files tasks were executed: "eslint", "jest --findRelatedTests"

enable different hooks using Husky
