# 267. Git Hooks Summary

By default Git allows you to commit any files, enter any commit message and doesn't perform any checks

hooks:

- pre-commit
- prepare-commit-msg

There are client and server hooks

You could enable only certain hooks

Git hooks = executable scripts

hooks are local, they are not pushed to remote;  
it is possible to automate a process of distribution of hooks to different computers

in pre-commit hook we perform selective linting and selective test runs only for staged JavaScript files
