# 247. How Git Hooks could be used on practice

examples:

1. Verify or edit commit message
2. Run application tests before each commit or before pushing to remote
3. Verify and potentially fix code syntax mistakes using linters like ESLint, Pylint
4. Generate notifications after successful committing: commit was already done
5. Deploy updated application to production on the server
