# 266. Verifying commit message using commitlint

we have added different dev dependencies to our Node.js application

Let's now ensure that every commit message will contain prefix ISSUE- to indicate for example JIRA ticket number, ticket assigned to specific developer in Jira system

install commitlint package

npmjs.com/package/@commitlint/cli

npm i -D @commitlint/cli

Mind the Husky's version: 4.3.8 and NOT 5! =>

```json
"husky": {
    "hooks": {
        "commit-msg": "commitlint -E HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS"
```

HUSKY_GIT_PARAMS = environment variable

configuration section for commitlint

order of the configuration parts in package.json doesn't matter

```json
  commitlint: {
    'rules': {
      'references-empty': [2, 'never'],
    },
    parserPreset: {
      parserOpts: {
        issuePrefixes: ['PROJ-']
      }
    },
  }
```json

ISSUE-: here could be for example JIRA board prefix

git commit -a -m "Added commitlint" => references may not be empty => failure  
git commit -a -m "[ISSUE-12] Added commitlint" => success

You could try to fix vulnerabilities automatically using npm audit fix

modify README.md file: add: Enter `npm install` after cloning to make use of all hooks

DEMO: Fix NPM vulnerabilities manually using npm audit fix:

1. STEP 1: Install all necessary NPM packages npm install  
There are vulnerabilities
2. STEP 2: Trying to fix vulnerabilities automatically npm audit fix  
Fixed!
3. STEP 3: Commit changes in the package files git commit -a -m "[ISSUE-10] Removed NPM vulnerabilities"
4. STEP 4: Install NPM packages once again to verify that vulnerabilities don't appear npm install
5. STEP 5: Push to the remote repository git push  
No more alert! Everybody is happy :)
