# 288. Exploring and reading Git Objects


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


ls .git/objects/ =>
only 2 folders, info and pack before creation of the very first commit;
and now, after a few commits, bunch of additional folders

ls .git/objects/ce/
03 + 3abd06... = complete SHA1 hash of a specific commit object

git cat-file -t 033abd0t => commit

You might see one the following types: blob, tree, commit

git cat-file -p 033abd0t => contents of the commit
first line is a tree (= folder in Git)

git cat-file -p this SHA1 hash: 4 blobs (files)
