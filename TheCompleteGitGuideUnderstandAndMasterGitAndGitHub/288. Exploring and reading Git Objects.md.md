# 288. Exploring and reading Git Objects


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


ls .git/objects/ =>
only 2 folders, info and pack before creation of the very first commit;
and now, after a few commits, bunch of additional folders

ls .git/objects/ce/
ce + 7fefcdcc... = complete SHA1 hash of a specific commit object

git cat-file -t ce7fefcdcc
