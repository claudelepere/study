# 280. Staging and Committing changes in one commandFIRST


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


If there are no untracked files and if there are only modified files, you can combine add and commit: git commit -a -m "message"

Such combined command will not commit untracked files.
Before committing, you need to add them to the staging area.
