# 280. Staging and Committing changes in one commandFIRST


> Written with [StackEdit+](https://stackedit.net/).


If there are no untracked files and if there are only modified files, you can combine add and commit: git commit -a -m "message"

Such combined command will not commit untracked files.
Before committing, you need to add them to the staging area.

[main b585674] Changes in the first file
Author: Claude Lep√®re <claudelepere@gmail.com>
1 file changed: 1 insertion(+), 1 deleteion(-)
```
branch pointer moves automatically to the last commit and HEAD still points to the main branch
